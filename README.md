# dialect-quiz-bot

A Rasa bot that lets you take a dialect quiz similar to the [New York Times dialect quiz](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/dialect-quiz-map.html) which was based on the [Harvard dialect survey](https://www4.uwm.edu/FLL/linguistics/dialect/maps.html). 

This project is still in active development and you can watch live-coding on [the Rasa YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL75e0qA87dlFvomavOFBIX6S9IvtGAXjM).
